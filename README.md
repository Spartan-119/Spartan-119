### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I code. Currently working as Data Scientist at VIRAL.<br>
I am into learning boxing these days. It was a mistake!<br>
Have been playing ðŸŽ¸ for over 10 years. So, if you got a gig, ping me yeahðŸ¤˜<br>
I am also guilty of spending too much time PETTING DOGS. <br>

ðŸ¤” So why "Spartan-119"? I used to play Halo a lot, and innit the protagonist is [John-117](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/John-117) aka Spartan 117, since he was part of the [Spartan program](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/SPARTAN-II_Program). I just tweaked a bit and changed 117 --> 119, based on my favourite Psalm ([Tehillim 119](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.119?lang=bi)).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs), Classical and Deep Machine Learning, data structures & algo, and boxing-related-stuff.

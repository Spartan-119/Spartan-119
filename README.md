### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science at Kingston University London. I used to work as an Associate in the Data Science & Machine Learning (DSML) Track at Infosys. Currently focused on Data Analysis methods using Python, classical Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

I am an attentive computer science graduate, competent in data structures & algorithms, and data analysis along with using my knowledge of statistics and other paradigms of mathematics for automation, used for prediction which I am led to believe is called Machine Intelligence or AI these days.

I also like debating, reading books on Philosophy, Psychology, and technology. I am also guilty of spending too much time PETTING A DOG. 

ðŸ¤” So why "Spartan-119"? I used to play Halo a lot, and init the protagonist is [John-117](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/John-117) aka Spartan 117, since he was part of the [Spartan program](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/SPARTAN-II_Program). I just tweaked a bit and changed 117 --> 119, based on my favourite Psalm ([Tehillim 119](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.119?lang=bi)).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning, Linear regression, data structures & algo, and guitar-related-stuff.

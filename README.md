### Hi there 👋
I am an attentive computer science
graduate, competent in data
structures & algorithms.

I view Computer Science as a universe, & I believe a firm knowledge of data structures, algorithms, basic knowledge of mathematical paradigms like calculus and matrices equips an individual to learn, take on, and kill any subset within this universe - be it Pen testing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Software development or anything. Enough with philosophy now!

I am also a proficient public speaker, who in my spare time would be found reading a book, playing guitar or PETTING A DOG.

🌱 I’m currently learning Deep learning, NLP, and Pen Testing (and HOLY CRAP, arent they tough!)

💬 Ask me about Machine Learning, Linear regression, data structures & algo, and guitar-related-stuff.
